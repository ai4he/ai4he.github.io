    title: "Human-Centered AI"
    content: "
      We study methods to involve humans in all the different processes of the machine learning pipelines.
      Our approach include different stages such as the design, data production (collection and labeling), model training, and deployment.
      Detection and reducing bias in data are essential components of our methodology.
      <br>
      The implementation of socio-technical system allows us to design and evaluate systems with the different stakeholders.
      We conduct ethnographic studies to understand how people expect to interact with smart agents and align the solution to their expectations.
      The resulting human-centric solutions are usually published as open source tools so the community can adopt them."

    title: "AI For Social Good"
    content: "
      We study methodologies on how AI-powered systems can promote a bennefit to society.
      Our approach involves the design and development of interventional tools that can interact with people within communities.
      The mediated communication principle help up to promote frictionless interactions and reduce power imbalances.
      <br>
      Social networks help us to understand how these tools can intervene in multiple contexts.
      We analyze data from social network to understand patterns in the interactions.
      Our interventional approach help us to moderate and promote safe spaces."

    value: "
      According to the findings of new research, AI could one day be able to instruct humans in the art of independent thought. According to the findings         of a study that was carried out by a group of academics at MIT, it is possible that AI might provide people a means by which they can learn how to         think for themselves and make judgments independently. The research included the use of an algorithm for machine learning to the process of training       a model that could be utilized to think about issues and come up with answers. The model was able to address challenges that entailed how to make a         choice, how to store data, and how to find a solution to the problem."

       This project is the first of its type to ever employ AI to teach people how to think independently for themselves. The study group thinks that this        might be a means for people to become more informed and effective in the field of decision-making, and they feel that this could be accomplished by        using artificial intelligence."
