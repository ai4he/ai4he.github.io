      We refer as empowerment to the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities.
      We study how AI can assist individuals in becoming more self-sufficient and help them to advance in their goals. 
      The objective is to help people to become more confident in controlling their life and to enhance their potential to influence the world around them.
       <br>
      On the algorithmic approach, our work expands on the knowledge of AI Empowerment that explores the potential an agent perceives that it has to influence its environment. 
      We explore how different machine learning approaches can help agents to identify and learn from human interactions and adapt according to the immediate bennefit for humans.
      The evaluation of the AI outcomes is a key component of our technology to promote Trustworthy AI solutions."

    title: "Well-being"
    content: "
    We study how AI can intervene in our daily lives to promote wellness in different dimentions such as the mental, physical, economic, amd emotional well-being.
    We focus in understanding how to measure and parametrize well-being measurements that algorithms can use to optimize their outcome.
    Our group explores how machine learning models that learn from subjective factors can gradually improve their perceived performance.
     <br>
    Our approach starts from applying quantified-self method where humans are willing to understand how they are performing periodically.
    Humans can assist algorithms to understand the meaning of the collected data and how these digital traces can be linked to a direct bennefit for them.
    We develop technology to track these digital traces to train algorithms that can help individuals towards their goals.

      Mutually beneficial artificial intelligence is advantageous because it fosters cooperation between humans and artificial intelligence. Together, they       can work to better the world for everyone's benefit. Artificial intelligence can assist us in making better decisions and in comprehending                  information. It can help us discover innovative ways to enhance the quality of life for all individuals.
      A potential advantage of mutually beneficial artificial intelligence is that it could assist individuals in automating their life, enabling them to         complete more work without losing focus. Additionally, mutually beneficial artificial intelligence could be employed to increase the productivity of      persons completing work with it, resulting in enhanced performance.

      The use of artificial intelligence may also assist people in developing a deeper understanding of themselves as well as the dynamics of their               interpersonal connections. The use of artificial intelligence may assist people in making choices and doing activities that they are already               acquainted with in a more effective manner. The human race may also benefit from the use of artificial intelligence by enhancing their ability to            remember and comprehend information.The development of self-awareness and the pursuit of purpose in one's life may both be facilitated by the use          of artificial intelligence."

      Analyses of real-world situations performed by 
      artificial intelligence. In many instances, the environments used to 
      evaluate artificial intelligence will be analogous to real-world environments,
      with the exception of the use of distinct techniques and technology. An assessment 
      of artificial intelligence is conducted with the objectives of determining whether
      or not AI is successful and efficient, choosing the appropriate tool for the 
      task at hand, and determining whether or not training is required."

    value: "
       A practical assessment of AI would include 
       picking a problem to solve that involved avoiding and navigating obstacles, 
       deciding which tool was best suited for the task at hand, and evaluating 
      the AI's level of efficiency and effectiveness. would have to be done in 
      order to decide whether training is required."
