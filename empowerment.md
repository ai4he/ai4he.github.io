      The objective is to help people to become more confident in controlling their life and to enhance their potential to influence the world around them.
       <br>
      On the algorithmic approach, our work expands on the knowledge of AI Empowerment that explores the potential an agent perceives that it has to influence its environment. 
      We explore how different machine learning approaches can help agents to identify and learn from human interactions and adapt according to the immediate bennefit for humans.
      The evaluation of the AI outcomes is a key component of our technology to promote Trustworthy AI solutions."

      Mutually beneficial artificial intelligence is advantageous because it fosters cooperation between humans and artificial intelligence. Together, they       can work to better the world for everyone's benefit. Artificial intelligence can assist us in making better decisions and in comprehending                  information. It can help us discover innovative ways to enhance the quality of life for all individuals.
      A potential advantage of mutually beneficial artificial intelligence is that it could assist individuals in automating their life, enabling them to         complete more work without losing focus. Additionally, mutually beneficial artificial intelligence could be employed to increase the productivity of      persons completing work with it, resulting in enhanced performance."

      The ability of artificial intelligence to assist people in comprehending and adapting to new ways of life is one manner in which AI contributes to          the well-being of humans. This has the potential to assist enhance the overall quality of life for people, as well as making them feel more               comfortable and successful in their lives. Artificial intelligence has the potential to bestow a great number of advantages onto human beings. The          use of artificial intelligence may assist people in gaining a deeper understanding of their environment as well as in expanding their knowledge           base. Humans may benefit from artificial intelligence not just in terms of their ability to enhance their communication abilities but also in terms          of their ability to better grasp the world around them."

      The use of artificial intelligence may also assist people in developing a deeper understanding of themselves as well as the dynamics of their               interpersonal connections. The use of artificial intelligence may assist people in making choices and doing activities that they are already               acquainted with in a more effective manner. The human race may also benefit from the use of artificial intelligence by enhancing their ability to            remember and comprehend information.The development of self-awareness and the pursuit of purpose in one's life may both be facilitated by the use          of artificial intelligence."

    value: "
      Analyses of real-world situations performed by 
      artificial intelligence. In many instances, the environments used to 
      evaluate artificial intelligence will be analogous to real-world environments,
      with the exception of the use of distinct techniques and technology. An assessment 
      of artificial intelligence is conducted with the objectives of determining whether
      or not AI is successful and efficient, choosing the appropriate tool for the 
      task at hand, and determining whether or not training is required."

    value: "
       A practical assessment of AI would include 
       picking a problem to solve that involved avoiding and navigating obstacles, 
       deciding which tool was best suited for the task at hand, and evaluating 
      the AI's level of efficiency and effectiveness. would have to be done in 
      order to decide whether training is required."
