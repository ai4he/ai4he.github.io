    title: "Who we are"
    discription: "
     The Human-AI Empowerment research group at Clemson University was founded in 2022 with the aim of studying the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for helping humans to achieve their goals. We conduct a Use-Inspired AI approach to understand how AI can be used in different contexts.
     <br><br>
     We believe that humans and AI can empower each other by defining mutually beneficial goals. We develop models and methods that can help machines to learn from humans by taking into account human cognitive biases and preferences. We aim to create algorithms that can optimize machine learning models according to human feedback, in order to improve the performance of the overall system."

    title: "What we do"
    discription: "
     Our group conducts studies to investigate how the use of artificial intelligence can enhance the performance of human activities and promote well-being. We seek to use artificial intelligence from different modalities such as audio, images, text, and telemetry data to understand human behavior from natural interactions. We collect and analyze data in the workplace for identifying trends and patterns that help machines to recommend better strategies to achieve our goals. This can assist humans in the decision-making process to make judgments that are more accurately based on data.
      <br><br>
      We perform experiments in real-world settings to identify the feasibility of current technologies in the wild. We explore the limitations of technology and define mitigation strategies to create accountable solutions. These tools are evaluated by users whose feedback feed the systems for continious improvement. The main goal of our research is understand how smart tools can help people to reach new opportunities and improve their lives."
